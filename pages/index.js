To resolve this, remove the unnecessary file. If you are adopting the App Router, remove `pages/index.js`.  If you're sticking with the pages directory for this route, delete `app/page.js`. 

**Example (Removing Pages Directory):**
```bash
rm -rf pages/index.js
```

**Example (Removing App Directory Route):**
```bash
rm -rf app/page.js
```
After removing the conflicting file, restart the Next.js development server.  The application should now render consistently.
